# CSS Data

This is a collection of data related to CSS. It contains various information like:
- A list of valid CSS properties, and their associated values
- A list of valid pseudo-classes
- A list of valid pseudo-elements
- A list of valid special characters

This data is used by [Yass CSS](https://github.com/yass-org/yass-css) to generate atomic classes. It exists because [MDN Data](https://github.com/mdn/data) does not currently maintain an array of valid values a CSS property can set. 

Note: This data is probably incomplete. If you notice something missing. Feel free to open a GitHub issue. 

Note: Be aware that the primary purpose of this data is to be consumed by [Yass CSS](https://github.com/yass-org/yass-css). As such, it is subject to breaking changes without warning.
